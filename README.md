# Drastic Maui Samples

This repo contains various samples of concepts and ideas you can use for your MAUI applications. As MAUI is an abstraction on top of the platforms you're targeting, you are always a step away from accessing those same controls. We could poke these controls the same we could if we were using the application platform "straight." With more knowledge of the platforms you're targeting, you can extend your apps further and get them closer to the metal.

This code may end up in the MAUI Community Toolkit, as a library of its own, or just here for you to learn. I do not support this as a general library.
